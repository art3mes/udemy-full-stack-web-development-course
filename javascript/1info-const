const in objects and arrays
const also works on objects and arrays. Attempting to overwrite the object throws an error "Assignment to constant variable".

const MY_OBJECT = { key: "value" };
MY_OBJECT = { OTHER_KEY: "value" };
However, object keys are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problem.

MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";

You would need to use Object.freeze() to make an object immutable.

The same applies to arrays. Assigning a new array to the variable throws an error "Assignment to constant variable".

const MY_ARRAY = [];
MY_ARRAY = ["B"];
Still, it's possible to push items into the array and thus mutate it.

MY_ARRAY.push("A"); // ["A"]

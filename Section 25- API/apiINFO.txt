an application programming interface (API) is a set of commands, functions, 
protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

points to remember while setting up APIs:

Endpoint: every api interacting with an external server has an endpoint.

                     eg: kanye.rest whose endpoint is https://api.kanye.rest

Paths:              endpoint/path

Parameters:     endpoint/path?contains=query          multiple queries separated by &

                    paths and parameters are used to narrow down search results

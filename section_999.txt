Since the node_modules directory is already tracked as part of the repository, the .gitignore rule will not apply to it.

You need to untrack the directory from git using

git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m "removing node_modules"

removing unremovable node_modules






using md5 creates same hash table for same input
example:  md5("1234")==md5("1234")    will return true


configuring express-session

1. require the package
2. setup sessions before mongoose connection and after express-app setup   (Choosing false is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. 
Choosing false will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.)

3. initialise and start using passpord , below step 2
4. initialise passport-local-mongoose  , just after userscheme
5. create local login strategy, serialization and deserialization using passport-local-mongoose just after usermodel
